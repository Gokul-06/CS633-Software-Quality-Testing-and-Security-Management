Overview of the Assignment:
Please analyze the described GIT process and respond to the following three questions.
Be sure to submit your completed assignment via Blackboard using the Assignment tool.  


Consider the sequence of ten steps, while collaborating with others to develop software,
 
1)	create your own branch 
2)	execute commits - make changes on your branch 
3)	execute unit test on your branch
4)	conduct peer review of changes on your branch
Invited the Collaborators @elentukh. @mbocca13. @TrimmBU.
And commented to peer review on the branch
5)	make additional changes on your branch 
6)	perform rebase from master into your branch
7)	resolve any conflicts that might occur from rebase
8)	attempt performing an auto-merge from branch into master
9)	if auto-merge does not go thru, perform manual merge
10)	resolve any conflicts that might occur from merge

Write few lines responding to each related question.

a)	What risks can you envision, if the rebase of step (6) is skipped? 

What potential issues can result in a rebase?

b)	Why it is important to stay on your own branch and not to commit into branches of other teams?

c)	What risks do you see when executing commits directly into master instead of your branch?


Follow the tutorial for an introduction to GitHub. https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
First, create your personal account at GitHub. Then, make sure your facilitator is invited to the repo through these commands, <Settings>, <Manage Access>, <Invite Collaborator>.

For you to receive a full grade, your facilitator needs to confirm these activities,



•	People interpret the notion of 'collaboration' quite differently. It would not be a surprise to read about 'holding hands and singing cheerful tunes' as a 'collaboration'. In a context of this class, we delve into such technical tasks as 'rebase' and 'merge' as key parts of 'collaboration'. In GitHub, members of a development team, respond to Pull Requests with comments and approval of a code change. In module 5, when covering Continuous Delivery, most 'collaboration' steps are subsumed by an extensive regression test. 
•	Rebase is an important concept in source control. During second module, we talk about rebase that can mess up your revision history. Here is the link to Git online book.

This is a truly comprehensive collections of all kinds scenarios. Note that in other source 
control systems, e.g. Clear Case, commands are different, although concepts remain the same. 
•	In this class, we prefer relying on a commonly used standard or a tradition. Brian Kernighan 
starts his classic 1978 book titled "C - Programming Language" with a tutorial - how to printf "Hello World".  Here we are a half a century later. See below the screenshot from GitHub tutorial, estimated as a 10 minutes read.
